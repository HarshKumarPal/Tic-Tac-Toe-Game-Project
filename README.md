# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game-Project
In this game, I used a tech stack that included HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and it is a simple project where I first made a navigation bar that displays MyTicTacToe.com 
after that made Game Skeleton using HTML where I used a gif image that displays when a player wins and styling using CSS. After completing the styling part I went on to
write the logic behind the working of the game which included the function to change the turn and the function to check for the win after which game logic started along
with the music played which included 3 music that is one which beeps each time we click on the 3x3 board with either 0 or X starting with X and after that also added
one click the listener to rest button after which the fresh game starts.  
After this, I added responsiveness to my game so that we can play the game in the same manner whatever the device may be with CSS media query. After this, I added a 
line animation on winning the game that is a line should be there on the 3 X's or 0's which are there present when the player wins the game to add beautify to the 
overall styling of the game using translate and transform property
